# SafeDriveUX/UI

The SafeDrive project addresses a critical issue of driver fatigue among truck drivers, leveraging advanced technologies like AI and infrared cameras to enhance road safety. Through three iterations, the project evolved significantly by incorporating user feedback from focus groups, workshops, and think-aloud tests. Each phase
of development provided valuable insights into user expectations and interaction patterns, enabling refinements in both functionality and design. Users appreciated the intuitive interface, clear navigation, and the potential of the system to improve safety on the roads. However, improvements were identified, such as integrating
voice controls, enhancing customization options, and refining alert mechanisms for better efficiency and user experience. While the results validate the core concept and design approach, further iterations and testing are recommended to optimize usability and ensure seamless integration into the daily workflow of truck drivers. By prioritizing user-centered design and ethical considerations.
